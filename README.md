# Controlling a Tech Element

This is an attempt to control a Tech Element from within a REPL.  
Note that you can connect to a channel and communicate to others that way as well



This project uses [PyScript](https://pyscript.net/) to
provide a version of the Python REPL in the browser. To
learn how it works [read these docs](https://docs.pyscript.net/latest/user-guide/terminal/).
